## Background
I am a 19 years old second year undergraduate student in UCSD. I'm from the Bay Area and have lived there since about 2012. I also have two dogs, and you can see a picture of them [here](#personal).

## Programming
I started programming when I was in fourth grade when my dad signed me up for the Girls in Tech workshop at his office. But, since I was just a kid I mainly programmed with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). 
### High School 
When I was in high school, I was part of the Computer Science Academy which was essentially a set of 4 courses that I would take during my four years in high school. With that in mind, I learned different aspects of Computer Science during those four years:
1. Freshman Year
    - MIT App Inventor : we spent about half the year learning how to build basic apps with the block code provided by [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/).
    - Python : We used Python's [Tracy the Turtle](https://codehs.com/hourofcode/tracy) program in order to code circles, squares, etc. By the end of the year, we had to program an intricate design based off of our knowledge of python and using the commands given to us by Tracy the Turtle. I coded a sunset.
2.  Sophomore Year (AP Computer Science Principles)
    - Java : the first line of code that I ever wrote in Java was:
      ```
      public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
      }
      ```
3. Junior Year
    - Cybersecurity : I took a single year of this course, and it was during quarantine. And it bored me so badly that I was praying to start coding again.
4. Senior Year (AP Computer Science A)
    - Java

### College
As I said before, I'm a second-year undergraduate student in UCSD. While in college I've learned a few different programming languages and techniques, though I still have more to do.
- [x] Lower Division Courses:
- [ ] Systems/Networks
- [ ] Language/Databases
- [ ] Learning/Vision/Graphics
- [ ] Security/Cryptography
- [ ] Electives
- [ ] Statistics

I'm also trying to get a minor in Mathematics, which means that I have to take the entire MATH 20 series, as well as four upper division Math courses. So far I've completed MATH 20A-D as well as Math 18. This quarter I'm taking MATH 18 as well. And the courses I have planned are:
- [ ] Math 183 : to fulfill my statistics requirement as well.
- [ ] Math 109 : Mathematical Reasoning
- [ ] Math 103A : Modern Algebra I
- [ ] Math 154 : Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory

This Github page is made for CSE 110 as part of Lab 1. Guidelines for the program are in the [README File](docs/README.md).

## Personal
1. I'm an **immigrant**. I was born in India and moved to the United States when I was barely a year old.
2. I am also an eldest daughter in my family.
3. I'm an avid watcher of Hindi and Marvel movies. My favorite quote from a Hindi movie is probably:
     > Apne aankhein band karlo aur iss Baarish ki har ek boond ko apne dil tak pahunch ne do.

Which loosely translates to: "Close your eyes and let every drop of this rain reach your heart."

4. I have two dogs. They're both Boxers, and their names are Beau and Lexie. Beau is about 4 years old and Lexie is about 3 years old.

5. I love reading books.
